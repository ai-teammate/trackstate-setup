# TrackState.AI Setup

This repository is the lightweight fork-and-run template for TrackState.AI.

Fork this repository to your own GitHub account or organization, enable GitHub Pages with **Source: GitHub Actions**, then run **Install / Update TrackState** from the Actions tab. The workflow downloads the selected version of `IstiN/trackstate`, builds the Flutter SPA for your fork, and deploys it to GitHub Pages.

## First install

1. Fork `IstiN/trackstate-setup`.
2. Open **Settings > Pages** in your fork.
3. Set **Build and deployment > Source** to **GitHub Actions**.
4. Optional: open **Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions > Variables** and configure GitHub App login:
   - `TRACKSTATE_GITHUB_APP_CLIENT_ID`: the GitHub App **Client ID** from the app's General settings, not the numeric App ID.
   - `TRACKSTATE_GITHUB_AUTH_PROXY_URL`: your auth broker URL. A static Flutter app must not contain a client secret or private key, so this broker exchanges the GitHub callback code for a user access token and redirects back to your Pages URL with `#trackstate_token=<token>`.
5. Open **Actions > Install / Update TrackState**.
6. Click **Run workflow**.
7. Keep `trackstate_ref` as `main` for latest, or enter a tag/commit SHA for a fixed version.

Your app will be published at:

```text
https://<owner>.github.io/<repo>/
```

## Updating TrackState

Run the same **Install / Update TrackState** workflow again:

- `main` installs the latest source from `IstiN/trackstate`;
- a tag such as `v0.1.0` installs that release line;
- a commit SHA pins the app to an exact build.

The workflow does not commit generated web assets to this repository. It publishes the compiled app as a Pages artifact, keeping the fork clean and focused on tracker data/configuration.

The deployed Pages artifact contains only the Flutter application. Tracker files are read at runtime from this repository through the GitHub API (`git/trees` for file discovery and `contents` for markdown/config reads), and writes are committed back with the GitHub Contents API.

## Repository permissions

Use a **Fine-grained personal access token (default)** when you want the
simplest setup path. Grant only the target setup repository and these
repository permissions:

- Metadata: Read-only
- Contents: Read and write

The optional GitHub App flow uses the same repository permissions and also
requires `TRACKSTATE_GITHUB_APP_CLIENT_ID` and
`TRACKSTATE_GITHUB_AUTH_PROXY_URL` before rebuilding the Pages artifact.

## CLI quick start

The generated app reads from `IstiN/trackstate` by default and uses
`DEMO/project.json` plus `DEMO/config/*.json` for editable tracker
configuration. Keep attachments under each issue's `attachments/` directory
and store large binaries through Git LFS.

## Login options

TrackState offers two login paths:

1. **Fine-grained token**: click **Connect GitHub**, paste a token with repository **Metadata: Read-only** and **Contents: Read and write**, and optionally enable **Remember on this browser**. Remembered tokens are stored in this browser/device storage so you do not need to paste them after every refresh. Do not enable this on shared machines.
2. **GitHub App login**: configure `TRACKSTATE_GITHUB_APP_CLIENT_ID` and `TRACKSTATE_GITHUB_AUTH_PROXY_URL`, then rebuild with **Install / Update TrackState**. The app redirects to the broker/GitHub flow and accepts a callback token from the URL fragment.

### GitHub App redirect setup

In your GitHub App settings, add your deployed Pages URL as a callback target:

```text
https://<owner>.github.io/<repo>/
```

Because GitHub's web authorization flow requires a secret exchange, the callback must be handled by your auth broker/proxy. The proxy should:

1. Receive the GitHub callback code.
2. Exchange it server-side using the GitHub App client secret/private key.
3. Redirect to `https://<owner>.github.io/<repo>/#trackstate_token=<user-access-token>`.

The Flutter app stores that token locally for the repository and uses it for read/write GitHub API calls.

## Tracker data

The demo project is stored in `DEMO/` using Git-native markdown and JSON files. You can replace it with your own project while preserving the same structure.

```text
DEMO/
  .trackstate/
    index/
      issues.json
      deleted.json
  project.json
  config/
    resolutions.json
  DEMO-1/
    main.md
    DEMO-2/
      main.md
      acceptance_criteria.md
      comments/
      links.json
      attachments/
        board-preview.svg
      DEMO-3/
        main.md
```

Issue frontmatter stores canonical machine ids such as `issueType: story`, `status: in-review`, `priority: high`, and `fixVersions: [mvp]`. Localized labels come from `config/` and `config/i18n/*.json`, while `.trackstate/index/*.json` provides the generated key/path and tombstone lookup artifacts needed for stable issue resolution after moves.

Large attachments should be stored through Git LFS. `.gitattributes` already tracks common binary formats.
